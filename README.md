# my-tf-framework-for-nlp-tasks
This project aims to help people implement tensorflow model pipelines quickly for different nlp tasks.

Our code supports running on **TensorFlow 1.x** now. (More details in **branch tensorflow-1.x**)

We will further consider developing a version suitable for tf 2.x.

We recommend to use tf 1.12 or 1.13 for our tensorflow-1.x version.
